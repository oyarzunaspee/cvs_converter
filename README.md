###### Works with a file location and a link !

A script that converts a .xlsx into a .csv file
_________________

#### How to use:

* Run the cvser.py script with the path of the .xlsx file you want to convert

` python3 cvser.py ./user/my_folder/my_file.xlsx `

* You can also provide a url

` python3 cvser.py https://www.myurl.com `

* You can also provide multiple arguments separated by a space, and combine both path and url

` python3 cvser.py ./user/my_folder/my_file.xlsx https://www.myurl.com `

* You will be asked to name the new .cvs file or files

* And it's done! You'll find the new .cvs files in the directory from where the script was executed
